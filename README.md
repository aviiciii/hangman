# HANGMAN GAME

[Video Demo](https://youtu.be/w0K4eoSaBMw)

## Description

Hangman Game is a terminal-based game implemented in Python. It allows players to guess letters to uncover a hidden word, with each incorrect guess leading to the drawing of a hangman. The word to be guessed is randomly chosen from a list of movies sourced from IMDb's top 100 movies list (as of August 2022).

The game consists of a main function and four other subprograms/functions: `select_movie`, `question`, `game`, and `get_result`. These functions are called from the main function in the respective order to control the flow of the game.

## Project Requirements

- The project must be implemented in Python.
- It should have a main function and at least three other functions, each accompanied by tests that can be executed with pytest.
- The main function should be in a file called `project.py`, located in the root folder of the project.
- The three required custom functions (other than the main function) should also be in `project.py` and defined at the same indentation level as the main function.
- The test functions should be in a file called `test_project.py`, also located in the root folder of the project. The test functions should have the same name as the custom functions, prepended with `test_`.
- Additional classes and functions can be implemented as desired.
- Any pip-installable libraries required by the project should be listed, one per line, in a file called `requirements.txt` in the root of the project.
